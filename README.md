# xmip-core-transport-tcp

TCP transport: one connection is one Stream. A technology of
[xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport), which
owns the direction-neutral `Transport` trait this crate implements (ADR-0010).

Lifted out of the capability crate on 2026-09-07, where it had lived as
`src/tcp` since 2026-08-27 waiting for this repository. The capability keeps
the trait, the error vocabulary and the shared wire helpers; nothing in it names
a protocol.

A Receive Location keeps its listener, bound on the first receive (`transport::kept::Kept`): a peer that connects between two receives is queued and taken by the next, where until 2026-09-27 each receive bound a listener of its own and a peer between receives was refused.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain for the whole estate. Do not change it
here.

## Verification

The included workflow is manual-only and calls the versioned shared workflow at
`IlleNilsson/.github@v1`.
